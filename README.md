# CO222-PROJECT
Crossword-Puzzle-Solver

For this project, we have to write a C program to solve a crossword puzzle. Our program should read, from 
standard input, a puzzle grid and a set of words and should print the solved puzzle to standard output.
This was a group project and the team mate was @19Kaumini
